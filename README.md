* ### "My spraycan/phone are way too big for the model!"
* Go into your FBX in your assets folder, and go into the model tab, on the top you'll see a "Scale factor" option. Change it to a larger number.
After doing this, delete the old character from the Chara prefab, and re-add the fbx (unpacking and organizing just as before). When adding the spraycan or phone again, they should look better!
